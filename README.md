A look into the UK's Food Standards Agency's establishment ratings.

## Steps to Follow:

### 1. Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up:

- Set up necessary libraries: `PyMongo` and `Pretty Print (pprint)`.
- Validate the data import and prepare the collection for usage.

### 2. Update the Database:

- **File:** NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb
- Add a new halal restaurant in Greenwich to the collection.
- Remove establishments in Dover.
- Convert specific number values from string to appropriate number types.

### 3. Exploratory Analysis:

- **File:** NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb
- Analysis of data to answer specific questions presented by "Eat Safe, Love" editors. 
- Use a combination of MongoDB commands and data visualization techniques.
  
## Notes:
Ensure the database is properly set up and accessible before starting the analysis. Refer to specific steps within the Jupyter notebooks for detailed guidance.
